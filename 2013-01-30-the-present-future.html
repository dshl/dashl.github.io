			<article class="">

					<h6><em>They say that with endings come new beginnings, I'd like to believe that to be true.</em></h6>

			<p>The end of the world has always held the fascination of men. As if our own unforeseeable demise wasn't enough, we spend our finite moments on this Earth crooning over its destruction. It was only a hundred years ago when <b>Robert Frost wrote, "Some say the world will end in fire / Some say in ice."</b> And like Frost, the Mayans' sang of fire, prophesying that a meteor would obliterate the sun and eclipse the Earth one winter solstice.</p>
			<p>Thus 12/21/2012, the shortest day of the year, became one of the longest. NASA, Mexico's archaeological institute, the Vatican, the Smithsonian Institution, the governments in places like China, Russia and France were all on the defense. The fateful day came, and passed (now seemingly so long ago). There was a collective sigh, but fear lingered in the exhale. Some thought that maybe the end of the world would serendipitously collide with the end of the year. In essence, the Mayans were wrong about the day, but the end was near, quite near. So Christmas appeared on the scene, cold and dry. Then a week later, the world watched the Times Square ball drop, and when it did, exhaled a collective sigh of relief for surviving another year.</p>
			<p>On the subway ride home, I read the NYT article, <a href="nyti.ms/1GfPHhy"><em>The Final Days</em></a> by Benjamin Anastas. He  chronicles the history of doomsday predictions as far back as the Gnostics who "predicated the imminent arrival of God's kingdom as early as the first century." The timeline includes the Shakers who believed the world would be over in 1792 and the Jehovah's Witnesses who pegged various years between 1914 and 1994. That night, I finished <a href="vnty.fr/1KVTU9v"><em>"Empire Falls"</em></a> by the historian Niall Ferguson. He argues that Europe and America in 2006 look disconcertingly like 406 AD – that is, the beginning of the end of the Roman Empire.</p>
			<p><b>Of course, the world has been ending since the beginning, and there have always been "The Religious" (Rapturists), "The Extremists" (Jihadists), and "The Psychedelic" (Burning Men) to keep the rest of us abreast on its developments. As an article by Kurt Andersen, <a href="nym.ag/1GfQ7EL"><em>The End of the World As They Know It</em></a>  summarized: "Apocalypticism is one of those realms where the ideological spectrum bends into a circle and the extremes meet."</b></p>
			<p>Developments in climate change and a nuclearized Iran have forced many to re-examine what once seemed fanatical. It seems like we're going through an existential reboot – a growing throng of people are joining the doomsday remnant. This is probably because the institutions expected to offer salvation, seem conspicuously silent. So we seek answers from each other, without success. And as we draw closer to the nihilistic abyss, all we have left is an overwhelming sense of weariness with the world – a feeling the Germans diagnose as Weltschmerz (from Welt 'world' + Schmerz 'pain'). Our question is that of J&uuml;rgen Habermas, "Should we continue to hold fast to the intentions Enlightenment had, however fractured they may be, or should we rather relinquish the entire project of modernity?" <sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">[1]</a></sup></p>
			<p><b>Our childhood heroes seemed to have everything figured out. Buzz Lightyear was right. "To infinity … and beyond" is the best approach to fate, man's last frontier.</b> In the 70s, this approach led to our interest in X-men (regular folks gifted with extraordinary powers), Superman (a Garden of Eden), and iRobot (a world dictated not by the Decalogue of YHWH, but by one of his chosen people, the late Isaac Asimov). It's the approach that fueled Western expansion, the same belief that manifested itself in the techno-scientific innovation of the Wright brothers, Rockefeller, Model Ts, and skyscrapers, and inspired the the moral fortitude of Ghandi, Margaret Thatcher, nonviolent protests and political deftness. If we cannot shake off the premonition that either progress has stalled, or worse, leading us towards destruction, it will mean that the Mayans may have missed the year, but altogether were right – the world is tethering on the edge. The end is soon to come.</p>
