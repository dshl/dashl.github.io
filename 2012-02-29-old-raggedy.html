    <h2><a href="2012-02-29-old-raggedy.html"></a>Old Raggedy</h2>
	<article class="">

			<p>Mr. Edwards was the longest occupant of 82 Adams Drive and his house was the oldest standing building on our street, a looming edifice that delighted the kids who decked it with toilet paper on Halloween. We called the house "Old Raggedy" because of its broken windows, peeling paint, and tattered confederate flag. Legend had it that in the presence of a full moon, the building would sway enchantedly in the night.</p>

			<p>Since Mr. Edwards rarely emerged from his home, the house must have worn off on him. He was a pale image of a man. He wore silver-rimmed glasses, donned the same faded white t-shirt, and left his house only to wobble back and forth to his mailbox with the aid of his walking stick.</p>

			<p>Every winter, the kids walking back from school would throw snowballs at Old Raggedy. Mr. Edwards would retaliate by kicking the screen door open with his cane, threatening to call the police. "Ruffians! Learn to respect authority" he would say. He never did call the police and every time, the kids would flee giggling. I never threw snowballs, but I did find the theatrical ceremony between my classmates and Mr. Edwards amusing.</p>

			<p>One winter, the school bus loaded off. As we drew closer to Old Raggedy, some kids started packing snow in their hands. A kid said, "I'm tired of throwing snowballs. Let's do something else." The statement hung silently in wisps of winter air until somebody replied, "Let's burn Old Raggedy."</p>

			<p>Murmur ensued. I was gripped by fear and wanted to run home. But it was too late. Everyone was now talking about how cool the flames would look; how one of the kids could steal a pack of matches from his parents; how not to get caught.</p>

			<p>I stopped walking and finally blurted in a choked cry: "This is not right guys." Silence. Then someone said, "Why not?" I couldn't think of a response, so they walked ahead and continued planning without me.</p>

			<p>That evening Old Raggedy was burnt down. Mr. Edwards was dragged out his home by a firefighter. He was startled, but uninjured.</p>

			<p>Amidst the screeching sirens and bystanders watching the conflagration light up the night sky, I asked myself once again, "Why not?" and with blurry eyes, I packed some snow and threw it at the ashes where Old Raggedy once stood.</p>
