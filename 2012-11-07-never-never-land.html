		<h6><em>When love is constrained or compromised</em></h6>

			<p>The fairy-tale depictions of love seem superficially plausible. However, <em>Sleeping Beauty</em> can be construed as misogynistic; <em>The Princess Bride</em>, escapist; and <em>High School Musical</em>, an anthem to the overused 'boy-meets-girl' gag reel. (Those who still cling on to these romanticized images of reality, do so nostalgically; tapping their ruby slippers once for love, twice for marriage, three times for a 'baby in a baby carriage'). The rest of us have supposedly come of age, reimagining the 'Disneyesque' conception of love with a padded-Abercrombie bra here, an Axe spray there, and some sexting sprinkled in between. Our imaginations have led to …</p>
			<p>Hook-up culture.</p>
			<p>But don't give us too much credit. Our seeming originality is far from original. "[A]s much as each [decade] imagines itself to be carving new territory out of nothing more than its own inspired creativity," says author Caitlin Flanagan in her article, <a href="theatln.tc/1Fm0xlx"><em>Love, Actually</em></a>. "Youngsters don't have enough experience to make anything new – or even to recognize what might be clichéd." From Flanagan's perspective, my generation's views on love are nothing different. I agree. <b>Millennials have grown into the counter-culture of yesteryear and made it primetime, replacing the idealism that inspired Woodstock with the modern materialism of our "sex sells" entertainment industry.</b> "All [we] know is the world [we] began to take notice of when [we] turned 12 or 13; all [we] can imagine doing to put [our] mark on that world is to either advance or retreat along the lines that were already drawn for [us]."</p>
			<p>"Hooking up" isn't radically new – it was coined at the turn of the decade and known to almost every prepubescent American child as a sexual experience. <b>Baseball was becoming an American pastime. The distinctive rhythms of the game (bases, pitching, swinging, stealing) were adopted for a more interesting contest: the game of love.</b> And with it, a slow sport, dependent upon parental consent or modest physical prompts (a deep blush, a biting of the lip), the game of love for the past ten years has been increasingly fleeting: skipping "first base," we walk onto "second," steal "second base" which is now "third," and, if we're lucky, slide into "fourth," or in other words, a homerun.</p>
			<p><b>LIBERATION OR BONDAGE</b></p>
			<p>There has been a lot of talk recently about relationships. And as Frank Bruni of the New York Times wrote in his recent article, <a href="nyti.ms/1Fm0Nku"><em>The Bleaker Sex</em></a>: "It comes at a moment of fresh examination of women's progress." Liza Mundy's <a href="nyti.ms/1cItmgS"><em>Breadwomen</em></a> asserts that women are all on their way to becoming the primary breadwinners. It will be joined later this year by Hannah Rosin's <em>The End of Men: And the Rise of Women</em>, which answers the question posed by the title of Maureen Dowd's prescient 2005 best seller, <em>Are Men Necessary</em>? (If you're wondering, the answer is a resounding, "No"). Whether this new female dominance is a fait accompli, a work in progress, or a state of affairs just waiting on the horizon, Rosin never seems to decide.</p>
			<p>Dowd's firebrand version of feminism also criticizes the growing chorus of laments over the sexual frontier. Are young women at the forefront of the sexual revolution? Rosin believes so. In fact, she claims that the whole of "feminist progress right now largely depends on the existence of the hookup culture." Swing the pendulum to the far right to find Caitlyn Flannigan. A born provocateur, Flanagan is a gifted satirist, and her stylish eviscerations of her targets delight few, and enrage many. For Flanagan, women are not benefiting, but succumbing to a casual attitude toward sex. Those who balk against the hookup culture are the "real progressives", she says, for they are making one of the last "great stands for human dignity."</p>
			<p><b>Regarding young women and sexuality, two cultural tracks have developed. So, which is it? Should we view dating from Flannigan's perspective – as antiquated, "socially corrosive and ultimately toxic to women" - or from Rosin's – another "engine of female progress?"</b> Whatever you decide, cultural cues continue to give mixed signals. Female empowerment has become a baffling mix of Margaret Sanger and the puritan silhouette of Anne Hutchison. The ideal women is between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five (or looks it); her hair is voluminous; her teeth is flashy-white; she has a career but is still a fabulous cook who knows how to seduce a man and keep him satisfied.</p>
	  <p>Flanagan's whining harangue sounds like a siren song that has lost its seductive timbre. Her unusually tame book <em>Girl Land</em> is a perpetuation of a tired picture of girls as victims-in-the-making despite her insightful social analysis. On the other hand, Rosin's argument ("I-am-women-hear-my-roar" ) reminds me of the iconic final scene of King Kong. Rosin is close to target when she says that: "We've landed in an era that has produced a new breed of female sexual creature, one who acknowledges the eternal vulnerability of women but, rather than cave in or trap herself in the bell jar, instead looks that vulnerability square in the face and then manipulates it." But Rosin misses the mark. The statement is meant to be another pound on her feminist breast, a shoutout to Thelma and Louise, ladies who turned in their lipstick and earrings for bandannas and cowboy guns. Except the "manipulation" that Rosin suggests turns out to be empty fist waving. <b>If women are aware of the cultural jar that entraps them, too many choose not to cry foul (at least not in public). Instead they find solace in the company of those similarly imprisoned, and dance in the pixie dust of their resiliency with an abandon that is tragically commendable.</b></p>
	<p><b>CONQUEST AND COMPANIONSHIP</b></p>
	<p><b>What about men? A close friend and mother told me that men type women into four categories: "mother, sister, wife, or one-night stand."</b> At first, I remember protesting, but quickly conceded. The statement is true, strikingly so. The continuing vogue of hookup culture perpetuates the ideal that the 'one-night stand' is not only the most prevalent female type, but also the most socially acceptable.</p>
	<p>On one side you have the <em>Jock</em>. He is pragmatically simple-minded about the state of affairs. Girls are either 'bad' or 'good'. The bad ones are easy to get and have obvious functions; and the good ones, a bit harder to pin down, are the keepers (aka, the one you want to have a long-term relationship with). At first the good girl plays 'hard to get,' pacifying advancements with a gentle pat on the knee or a change of subject. She will claim that she is not ready now, tactfully leaving space for the future possibility. From the jock's perspective, once pinned, the game is over. There is no patience with pious, sexless women. Even more complicated is the <em>Jerk</em>. He is a pseudo-intellectual, questionably amoral fellow who has affairs as a matter of course and doesn't (or says he doesn't) think less of a girl for sleeping with him. He has a quiver of complicated arguments on the subject of love, and his ability to communicate them with breathless speed assuages the fears of the current target.</p>
		<p>These caricatures are crude, but honest. <b>If hookup culture calls into question female empowerment, it should also concern itself with male maturity.</b> Of course the world is filled with more than just jerks and jocks. There are <em>gentlemen</em> who perhaps despise having to always consider the third party in their modern relationships – a partner's past lovers. Men who realize that the rise of hookup culture has granted them a Pyrrhic victory at the cost of true intimacy. Men who believe that sex is more than some selfish <em>quid quo pro</em>. Men who understand that sex is in part a death. A death to self. It's physical. It's messy. It's beautiful. It's total self-giving love.</p>
		<p>As it stands now, love might be constrained, to be sure; compromised even, but I'm not too worried. And neither is my generation. <b>Love still hovers in wait. We may continually push the boundaries of sexual freedom, but that's not how the story ends. When the lure of the casual wears off, we begin to demand more.</b> Not always marriage, or commitment, or even a return to a more chivalrous age, but something of simpler, childlike proportions: a date at an ice cream shop, a long conversation, a relationship that has a clear beginning, or end. <b>It's only human nature to desire more, to seek meaning, to dig deeper, and to do so with all our heartstrings attached.</b> Despite the risks of falling in love, a longing for our own happily-ever-after compels us to get up again, if only to fall once more. We may never return to our daydreams filled with fairy tales that we can stay forever young in never, never land. But I don't know if we want to. For now, it may be enough to believe in the beauty inherent in the fairytale of love, even if not in the story itself.</p>
