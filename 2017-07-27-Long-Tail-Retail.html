<div  id='write'  class = 'is-mac'><p>The all-out price battle between Walmart and Amazon is an opening skirmish in a larger war to win the “long tail” of a $674B retail market. In order to win in a Long Tail business (<a href='https://smile.amazon.com/Long-Tail-Future-Business-Selling/dp/1401309666?sa-no-redirect=1'>credit: Chris Anderson</a>), you must a) make everything available and b) help people find it (i.e., catalogue, or better yet, anticipate customer demand). What happened Friday was a deft response by Amazon to make everything available – a response to Walmart’s earlier acquisition of Jet.com. </p><p>I want to think through the “long tail” war of retail. Amazon and Walmart will be used as proxy for “brick-and-mortar” and “digital-first” companies. The goal is to illustrate the dynamics between physical, hybrid, and digital retailers in the long tail race towards infinite variety. </p><p>Amazon is buying competency into brick-and-mortar economics. Note that Amazon tried to learn brick-and-mortar economics on its own (and in its own way) with Amazon Go, which hopes to make checkout lines a thing of thing of the past, <a href='https://links10.mixmaxusercontent.com/b8KLoocAdup5ABDnG/l/n7N1U0ifbgYDDE7VM?messageId=O3cYHJ1ItLqilEQLz&rn=gIhVWeyFGTgwGblh2chRkI&re=ISbvNmLslWYtdGQhVWeyFGbuwGblh2chRmI'>Amazon Bookstores</a>, which  according to a New Yorker article is not for people who actually read, and now <a href='https://links4.mixmaxusercontent.com/b8KLoocAdup5ABDnG/l/n3OBfVGca5XOJq2LS?messageId=O3cYHJ1ItLqilEQLz&rn=gIhVWeyFGTgwGblh2chRkI&re=ISbvNmLslWYtdGQhVWeyFGbuwGblh2chRmI'>Prime Wardrobe (beta)</a>, a.k.a, Amazon’s fitting room as a service. <a href='https://links6.mixmaxusercontent.com/b8KLoocAdup5ABDnG/l/pP0HJSrhbBFYkXiZE?messageId=O3cYHJ1ItLqilEQLz&rn=gIhVWeyFGTgwGblh2chRkI&re=ISbvNmLslWYtdGQhVWeyFGbuwGblh2chRmI'>There are few kinks to work out</a> but building out a hybrid retail experience doesn’t happen overnight, especially for the grocery market. </p><p>So queue the Whole Food’s $13.7B acquisition, a deal 10X bigger than any other Amazon deal. Whole Foods, with its zero-growth, 450 stores, and 15.72B in net sales, doesn’t make it an obvious buy. And it get’s worse. Whole Foods, once the second-most valuable food retailer in the U.S., behind Walmart in the Fall of 2013, took a beating this year from cutthroat competition and price gouging, both of which have eaten away at earnings. Same-store sales growth fell from 8 percent to 4 percent, and its share price tumbled 10 percent (<a href='https://links4.mixmaxusercontent.com/b8KLoocAdup5ABDnG/l/0S4SwYFFW1FgIOZZ2?messageId=O3cYHJ1ItLqilEQLz&rn=gIhVWeyFGTgwGblh2chRkI&re=ISbvNmLslWYtdGQhVWeyFGbuwGblh2chRmI'>50% since 2015</a>). </p><p>So what’s going on? Economist Paul Romer’s says a “crisis is a terrible thing to waste” and I think that’s what we have here. Amazon purchased Whole Foods for its logistics and infrastructure, customer base, market data, and physical stores for bargain (~$42/share roughly 3% of its enterprise value). And furthermore, Amazon has plans to leverage e-commerce to lower the unit economic costs of the retail business model. If Amazon succeeds, it will become <a href='https://links6.mixmaxusercontent.com/b8KLoocAdup5ABDnG/l/6r3NLR3DHqG4bYvtl?messageId=O3cYHJ1ItLqilEQLz&rn=gIhVWeyFGTgwGblh2chRkI&re=ISbvNmLslWYtdGQhVWeyFGbuwGblh2chRmI'>a top 5 grocer</a>. </p><p>As an aside, I have met John Mackey (CEO of Whole Foods) many times, and I am friends with Raj Sisoda, the economist behind Conscious Capitalism, co-written by Mackey. Congrats to both of them for the acquisition. I highly respect both of these gentlemen for their mindful stance on the role of business in society.</p><p>Walmart is buying competency into a new digital-first environment. Yes, less tech-savvy than Amazon, but Walmart is no underdog. The company is second only to the U.S. government in size, and one in every 100 working Americans collects a paycheck from either Walmart or Sam&#39;s Club. Walmart’s motto is “everyday low prices” and it means it. The company has been running price-comparison tests in <a href='https://links2.mixmaxusercontent.com/b8KLoocAdup5ABDnG/l/Obad8NRUn3jEhXLhr?messageId=O3cYHJ1ItLqilEQLz&rn=gIhVWeyFGTgwGblh2chRkI&re=ISbvNmLslWYtdGQhVWeyFGbuwGblh2chRmI'>1,200 stores across the U.S.</a> to guarantee that it has the lowest prices in 80% of head-to-head offerings (granted Amazon has been running <a href='https://links4.mixmaxusercontent.com/b8KLoocAdup5ABDnG/l/rzQ1pwxOeLgYIIgdQ?messageId=O3cYHJ1ItLqilEQLz&rn=gIhVWeyFGTgwGblh2chRkI&re=ISbvNmLslWYtdGQhVWeyFGbuwGblh2chRmI'>price algorithms</a> of its own, and undercutting Walmart with success). </p><p>Enter the acquisition of Jet.com to help Walmart build its digital bench. So far, so good. Walmart now offers free two-day shipping and has seen <a href='https://links2.mixmaxusercontent.com/b8KLoocAdup5ABDnG/l/6yICGE4uFBHuidAKD?messageId=O3cYHJ1ItLqilEQLz&rn=gIhVWeyFGTgwGblh2chRkI&re=ISbvNmLslWYtdGQhVWeyFGbuwGblh2chRmI'>online sales grow 63%</a> over the last year. Yet Wal-Mart is not done. Enter Bonobos, the men’s fashion brand, which was acquired for <a href='https://links1.mixmaxusercontent.com/b8KLoocAdup5ABDnG/l/gOp66xLSBi8XvOCpK?messageId=O3cYHJ1ItLqilEQLz&rn=gIhVWeyFGTgwGblh2chRkI&re=ISbvNmLslWYtdGQhVWeyFGbuwGblh2chRmI'>$310M or ~2x projected revenue in 2017</a>.</p><p>The shopping spree seems like a splurge if you consider the combined $166 million spent on fashion startups <a href='https://links1.mixmaxusercontent.com/b8KLoocAdup5ABDnG/l/mXLt2US3PeDupwyKY?messageId=O3cYHJ1ItLqilEQLz&rn=gIhVWeyFGTgwGblh2chRkI&re=ISbvNmLslWYtdGQhVWeyFGbuwGblh2chRmI'>ModCloth</a> and <a href='https://www.recode.net/2017/1/5/14173852/walmart-jet-shoebuy-acquisition-70-million'>ShoeBuy.com</a> but these investments are crucial if Walmart wants to stay relevant in a digital-first world. From a cash expenditure point of view, it is easier to become a digital-first retailer, than to build (and acquire) brick-and-mortar shops – a boon for Walmart. </p><p>Who will win the long tail of retail? Companies that quickly build or buy competency in both “brick-and-mortar” and “digital-first” strategies. Between, Amazon and Walmart. I’ll invest in both, rooting for the underdog (i.e.,Walmart) but expecting Amazon to win because even with Walmart’s head-start (i.e., more of the long tail and lower costs for user acquisition), Amazon doesn’t have 55 years of corporate culture to unravel and Amazon has a larger commerce vision to become “the everything store,&quot; <a href='https://links6.mixmaxusercontent.com/b8KLoocAdup5ABDnG/l/CnJ9Q0Wfi9T3lTToq?messageId=O3cYHJ1ItLqilEQLz&rn=gIhVWeyFGTgwGblh2chRkI&re=ISbvNmLslWYtdGQhVWeyFGbuwGblh2chRmI'>according to Brad Stone</a> – so, not just retail, but the entire value chain of creating, buying, and selling goods and services. </p><p>That said, I’m watching Amazon with a bit of trepidation over the next 2 years because Whole Foods is a significant investment and possibly, Bezos’ largest blunder. Retail is hard and Amazon is climbing uphill the long tail of a power law curve that looks a bit Sisyphean. While Walmart is trying to slide down the tail without tumbling over itself. </p></div>
