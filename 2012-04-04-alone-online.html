				<h6><em>The struggle to find meaning in the solitude of being alone, and in the companionship of being together</em></h6>

					<p>Every generation finds a mode of expression for which it is remembered. Cavemen allegedly documented their primitive lives in pictures. Sixties youth marched to the drumbeats of Woodstock. My generation connects online via YouTube links and Facebook pokes, #140CharactersOrLess and millions of tiny windows blinking with our hopes and dreams, defining who we are and who we consider "friends."</p>

					<p>So as I started to contemplate what it means to grow up online, I asked for a second opinion and turned to my 18-year-old sister Rachel who, at the time, was two months away from graduating high&ndash;school. A part of our conversation is transcribed blow:</p>

					<p><b>Me:</b> Have you ever 'un-friended' anyone on Facebook?</p>

					<p><b>Rachel:</b> When I go off to college, I'm going to 'unfriend' a lot of my Facebook friends &mdash; I only need like two.</p>

					<p><b>Me:</b> (smirking) Why?</p>

					<p><b>Rachel:</b> I have no interest in keeping most of them as my friends; most of them are underclassmen, some are from other schools, and a few of them I never talk to … I just don't need that many [friends].</p>

					<p><b>Me:</b> So, what do you use Facebook for?</p>

					<p><b>Rachel:</b> (sarcastically) Don't you have a Facebook?</p>

					<p><b>Me:</b> I'm just saying, what would you do with only two friends?</p>

					<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really, I don't know. I just go on to see if anyone is interacting with me and look at pictures. I don't go out and find people anymore.</p>

					<p>My sister then proceeded to login to her Facebook account and scroll through her friends. It's a bit overwhelming, seemingly never-ending, and every once in a while, perplexing.</p>
					<p>"Who in the world is that person?", I say.</p>
					<p>"I have no clue. I definitely am not this person's friend." she responds. </p>

					<p>Rachel clicks on the profile picture of the person in question, scans the 'About Page' and realizes that they met way back when at some inconsequential event through a mutual friend. Come to find out, she has not talked to this friend for more than that one momentary brush when they exchanged a handshake, a smile, and names soon to be forgotten (or, remembered long enough to friend each other on Facebook). Accordingly, my sister did what millions like her do every day – she 'un-friended' her "friend."</p>

					<p>A survey by NM Incite, a Nielsen McKinsey company specializing in data on social media, polled over 1.8K social media users and found that <a href="prn.to/1Ht58oc">the average Facebook user has 229 friends, 89% of whom they've met in person more than once, while a full 7% are people the user has never met face-to-face.</a> The "largest single group of Facebook friends consists of people from high school", according to the study, which noted that, on average, Facebook users have 56 friends from high school, 30 from college or university, and 15 from work. The idea of "cleaning out" Facebook friends is getting more popular: The percentage of people un-friending other Facebook members rose from 56% in 2009 to 63% in 2011. In gross terms, 158 million people were un-friended in 2009, and more than a half a billion in 2011.</p>

					<p><b>The craze to 'have-the-most-friends' is over. Of course, people still want friends, but it's no longer a competition for social status.</b> Whenever I acknowledge someone's friendship on Facebook, I usually write some pithy comment like "Hey [insert name here], we're now officially friends." Stupid, I know. But I remember when this was more true than trite.</p>

					<p>There was a time when Facebook was still the virtual jungle for those under the age of 25 and it was filled with college guys looking for their next date, high school mean-girls with airbrushed profile pictures, and middle-school-wannabes. The only thing that mattered was how you were perceived online, so if it wasn't on Facebook, it didn't matter and it didn't exist. If someone wanted to know your favorite artist, movie, (book, for those who still read) all that person would need to do is check your 'About Page.' Profile pictures were changed daily, and profile pages were mini documentaries of a person's life with all of its joys (11:50 am: Bobby, the cute boy in the third row just 'liked' me) and disappointments (12:30 pm: I hate Bobby! He's going out with my best friend, Cindy).

					<p>Facebook was a popularity contest on steroids, and the more friends you had the cooler you were. But we've now realized that Facebook isn't another Pokémon game. We can't "catch them all" - and we don't want to. So we 'unfriend' our once collectible red-head Susies and one-of-a-kind-brown-eyed Michaels. But, considering they where never really our friends in the first place, no harm, no foul – right? We're simply "[cutting] out some of the friend fat in [our] life", according to Jimmy Kimmel, who also enshrined the practice into a holiday and even gave it its <a href="abcn.ws/1Bax7kX">own theme song.</a></p>

					<p><b>Friend "clutter" actually makes Facebook less useful. The amount of friends you have on Facebook is inversely proportional to the amount of relevancy any given news feed story can have for you.</b> I spent one afternoon engaging Facebook's "useful Lists" feature to organize my friends into separate news feeds only to never use it, because at the end of the day, who wants to look through five different news feeds to discover one post that you actually care about.</p>

					<p>The un-friending phenomenon suggests that many users are starting to view Facebook as a utility. <b>Instead of an online hangout spot, Facebook has slowly turned into a gimmick to promote, manage, and chronicle our lives. Facebook noticed this trend and decided to undergo a makeover to facilitate our self-absorption. Enter Timeline.</b> Ironically, we may have asked for this update, but we definitely don't want it. Ever since Facebook's new Timeline layout, people have gotten riled up. Nobody likes the change, but we usually get used to change after a while. Well, it has been a while, and people are still pissed off. For myself, it has almost been two years, and I still have mild heart-attacks whenever I log into my Facebook account, fearing that my page will switch (and permanently so) into Timeline mode. Earlier this year I expressed my concerns in a public post:</p>
						</br>
					<blockquote><p>Dear Facebook … Your customers are using Facebook in innovative ways that are already pushing the FB envelope without structured guidance. Personally, Timeline reminds me of the days of MySpace: it is simple, egocentric, and 'scrapbook-ish' in a world that is becoming more professional. Please do not mandate a switch to Timeline. This will be the final straw for many who will find use of other websites already budding unto the Internet social scene.</p>
						<p style="text-align: left;"><a href=""><a href="https://www.facebook.com/dlaryea/posts/10150519927968434">Facebook Post, Apr 2012</a></p>
						</blockquote>

					<p>Timeline was announced this past Fall.</a> At a press Q&amp;A during the F8 conference in September, Mark Zuckerberg said that older users respond more negatively to Timeline than younger ones but that would not stop Facebook from making big changes: "The world is moving quickly, and we want to be innovative and try new things", he said. For a company that single-handedly wrote the manual on social media, <b>it seems pathetic for Facebook to believe that the next "new thing" is to give its users personal time-capsules!</b> Thanks Facebook, and by the way, where is the shovel, it's time to bury my account. I'm not alone in this sentiment. In an online survey by SodaHead, <a href="bit.ly/1AdLx9b">70% of people said they did not like the Timeline design and that Facebook should get rid of it.</a></p>

					<p style="text-align: center;">■</p>

					<p>My mother used to write letters when I was a boy. She occasionally wrote one to me while I was still in primary school. I must have been in the fourth grade when I received my first letter, and honest to goodness I almost wet my pants when my teacher, Mrs. Globe informed me that I was expected at the front desk of Ball's Bluff Elementary. In my mind, the 'front desk' was teacher code for being sent to the principle's office. On a list which  includes the teacher's lounge and the girl's bathroom, the principle's office is a place where a young boy never wants to find himself. These places are shrouded in mystery, superstitions, and Moaning Myrtles. So you can imagine my relief when I arrived at the front desk to be quickly shooed back to class with a letter from my mother. Now my mother texts. It took her about three months to get accustomed to translating her thoughts (once linked by single complex strokes) into abbreviated text-type and emoticons. Though, in old habit, she still begins many of her texts with "Dear Son."</p>

					<p><b>I've deleted all the text messages, but I've kept the letters – <em> all of them </em> – from mom, extended family, and friends. And I sometimes return to these letters because they remind me of a time when you could still hear a person's voice through his words.</b> </p>

					<p>Sherry Turkle, founder of MIT's Media Lab, has studied the interactions between people, artificial intelligence, and artificially social programs since their development in the late 1960's. Turkle's most recent book, <em>Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other</em> is written as the culmination of years of research and is the third in her trio of books on human-computer relationships (preceded by <em>The Second Self</em>, 1984 and <em>Life on the Screen</em>, 1995). <b>Turkle writes, "Technology proposes itself as the architect of our intimacies. These days, it suggests substitutions that put the real on the run."</b> <sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote"> [1]</a></sup> It's no surprise that by Part II of her book, "Networked: In Intimacy, New Solitudes", Turkle announces, "We are all cyborgs now." The Internet revolutionized the way we think, remember, and communicate. We, as humans, have been enhanced like robots. But in light of this transformation, Turkle cautions that our upgrades "may leave us with lives of less."</p>

				<p>The more we connect online, the farther we drift from each other, discontented, and nagged by the feeling of being "alone together." <b>We've become "consumed with that which [we are] nourished by." <sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote"> [2]</a></sup> Step into any college auditorium</b>: the professor begins his lecture by acknowledging the crowd with a cough followed by a half-wit comment about the day, the weather (anything really), and then reads his lecture notes in monotone cadence. As the professor speaks, laptops flicker open, fingers fly across keyboards, and intense concentration fills the room. But not many in the audience are listening to the professor. The person on your left is scrolling through <em>The New York Times</em>, while she plans an event on Google Docs with the classmate beside her, all while recording the lecture on her laptop. On your right, the person is sending e-mails and chatting on Facebook. <b>The professor drones on, knowing full well that he is lecturing to only a quarter of his audience, who soon too will be otherwise occupied by their screens or their thoughts. At the end of the lecture, students file out the auditorium, and even though they spent the past two hours "together" in person, they were worlds apart and alone, online.</b></p>

					<p style="text-align: center;">■</p>

					<p>It may seem strange to diagnose a generation with 'collective solitude' in an age seemingly marked by 'collective solidarity' but analyze any humanitarian campaign in the past five years: Egypt (Arab Awakening), South Sudan (Darfur), and Uganda (KONY 2012). My generation's knack to unify over human rights issues has been crowned by some as the rebirth of a 'White Savior Complex.' In an article bluntly titled, <em>The White Savior Industrial Complex</em>, Teju Cole of The Atlantic wrote: <a href="theatln.tc/GFdXWH">"From Sachs to Kristof to Invisible Children to TED, the fastest growth industry in the US is the White Savior Industrial Complex/ I disagree with the approach taken by Invisible Children in particular, and by the White Savior Industrial Complex in general, because there is much more to doing good work than 'making a difference.'"</a> <b>From behind our screens, we imagine ourselves hand in hand with the oppressed. But what we're really doing is losing touch with reality and the fact that people's lives may well depend on how effective our reaction is, not just that we react at all.</b></p>

					<p><b>Maybe we do feel a bond with our distant compatriots because distance has become part of our collective reality. <b>We live in a world where we're not sure what kind of attention we owe ourselves or each other.</b> People put their cell phones on the table now and don't think twice. Sherry Turkle recounts a story where one of her students recounted the first time he felt "alone together." He was simply walking with a friend, who received a phone call, and answered. "What was I, on pause? I felt I was being put on pause", he remarked. This is not a situation to be judged, just acknowledged. I mean, let he who is without sin, cast the first stone. Who could blame the friend for feeling like a third-wheel; and, on the other hand, who could say that a phone call isn't important, especially in an world where being up-to-date is the difference between being a true friend or a jackass.</b></p>

					<p>It makes you wonder whether, as a generation, we are losing ourselves in a world within the machine – a world that distorts reality and distracts us from facing our problems in reality. These days, whether you're online or not, it is easy for people to end up unsure if they feel closer together or father apart. We are connected all day, but unsure if we've communicated. In the meantime we socially negotiate what kind of attention we owe each other, waiting to be called upon, waiting to be liked, or tweeted, waiting to be hailed into existence.</p>

					<p>All this seems a bit extreme &mdash; for some, absurd. An argument could be made that I'm simply nostalgic for a past quickly fading – a time without robots, cell phones, computers, and the Web. I am unabashedly nostalgic. I think we all are. Those who are not should fear being blindly optimistic with this new normal. The "social network" does not intrinsically foster meaningful connections. It may not foster connections at all. If it were so, we wouldn't be using Facebook to "unfriend", Twitter to "unfollow", and Skype to feel physically close, while remaining mentally elsewhere. <b>I do believe that the Internet has the capacity to bring us together and to show us the wonders of our shared experiences: birth, love, pain, and death. Though, it is us – and, only us – who can find meaning in the solitude of being alone, and in the companionship of being together. Only us.</b></p>
