                          <p>Today is a good day. I’m joining Google to invest in the most innovative organizations making the world a better place for everyone.</p>
                          <p>My primary assignment will be to help the Google.org team run <a href="https://www.google.org/our-work/google-impact-challenge/">Global Impact Challenges</a>, an initiative that invites nonprofit founders and social entrepreneurs to submit their best ideas on how to solve the hardest socio-economic problems of our time, which includes the fact that <a href="http://www.naacp.org/criminal-justice-fact-sheet/">1 in 3 black men in America</a> can expect to be imprisoned in their lifetime; <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/12/09/the-american-middle-class-is-losing-ground/">the majority of Americans today struggle to reach the middle class</a>; around the world, <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/employment-and-growth/connecting-talent-with-opportunity-in-the-digital-age">250 million school-aged children (mostly girls)</a> are not being taught how to read; and, <a href="http://www.who.int/surgery/challenges/esc_disasters_emergencies/en/">2.6 billion people have been affected by natural disasters</a> such as earthquakes and floods in the past decade. We cannot rest on the laurels of how far we’ve come; there is still work to be done.</p>
                          <p>“If you can’t invent the future, the next best thing is to fund it,” says John Doerr. Fortunately, at Google.org, I can invest in people using technology for good. For example, HacktheHood, an Oakland-based nonprofit which has trained over 5,000 low-income, young adults with the software development skills necessary to build websites for small businesses which can’t afford to hire technical employees full-time. Or SANA an organization in India that is combining solar-powered micro-ionizing water purification and biodigesting technology to provide 54 million liters of safe drinking water to residents in rural villages.</p>
                          <p>I believe that entrepreneurs will continue to change the world—not only in the products and services we use, but in the causes we support, the role models we admire, and ultimately how we define the “good life.” In the process, we will create organizational models that direct capital in more intentional ways. As a result, archaic partitions like “nonprofit vs. for-profit” will be torn and we will discover that our best, most human ideas are at the intersection of “doing good” and “doing well.”</p>
                          <p>For decades, the only instruments used to improve social and environmental conditions were grants or concessional finance. It was never enough. Recently there has been a shift to find new ways to leverage the assets of philanthropists, governments, and the private sector.</p>
                          <p>We are beginning to see industry titans like Goldman Sachs and billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones create new financial vehicles, like the <a href="https://justcapital.com/reports/introducing-the-just-etf/">"Just ETF"</a> to help investors buy shares in U.S. companies that are driving positive change. Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon have repeatedly called for companies to <a href="https://work.qz.com/1299731/warren-buffett-and-jamie-dimon-are-working-to-break-corporate-american-of-a-nasty-habit/">stop issuing quarterly earnings guidance</a> to encourage forward-looking investments—with growing evidence of the effectiveness of the business strategy. A McKinsey report tracking 48 investor exits between 2010 and 2015 found that they produced a median internal rate of return (IRR) of approximately 10 percent with the top one-third of deals yielding a median IRR of 34 percent, clearly indicating that it is possible to achieve profitable exits in social enterprises. Overall, the amount of money invested in "world changing causes" doubled to $228 billion in 2018, according to the <a href="https://thegiin.org/">Global Impact Investing Network</a>, which is up an estimated $114 billion since mid-2017.
                          </p>
                          <p>Governments are also stepping up and adopting multilateral treaties such as the <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement">Paris climate accord</a> and the <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a> to coordinate action around global issues, including poverty, inequality, peace and justice. In the United States, the federal government passed the Jobs Act of 2017, a promising piece of legislation which encourages investment into low-income urban and rural “Opportunity Zones” needing economic development.</p>
                          <p>Among the philanthropic community, we see a commitment by the world's wealthiest individuals and families to dedicate the majority of their wealth to <a href="https://givingpledge.org/">The Giving Pledge</a>, and at the same time, a new generation of nonprofits, like <a href="https://newstorycharity.org/100-percent/">New Story</a> are asking private donors  to primarily fund operations and risk and development in order to ensure that 100% of public, crowdsourced funds go directly to beneficiaries. Data-driven research organizations like <a href="https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/">Centre for Effective Altruism</a>, <a href="http://www.givewell.org/">GiveWell</a>, among others are identifying investments where one could get “the most bang for your buck” and notable philanthropists, like Bill and Melinda Gates are using the due diligence to fund affordable solutions on pace to eradicate, not just prevent, epidemics like malaria. In a similar vein, “data-driven, human philanthropy” is the motto of Google.org, which has made early, high impact bets on organizations such as <a href="https://www.google.org/our-work/education/khan-academy/">KhanAcademy</a> and <a href="https://www.google.org/our-work/economic-opportunity/give-directly/">Give Directly</a> before the rest of the world believed in them. The breadth and depth of Google.org’s ambition with investment and grant commitments across racial justice, educational opportunity, crisis response, and artificial intelligence—totaling over $100 million—is yet another reason to be optimistic about the future.

                          <p>What I’m joining next is more than a company, but the crest of a growing movement. Cowabunga! Thank you to all those who have helped me over the past few months, including Josh, Krystal, Dave, Brinleigh, Kevin, Sasha, Lalitha, Felix, Mike, Ann, Arjun, Jo, Alexandra, Ratna, Udai, Maninder, Francesca, Philippe, James, Niket, Zach, Steven, and Rahfin.</p>
                          <p>Best,<br>Dash<p>
