		<article class="">

			<p>This time of year, the summer evening settles down</br>
			Bathed in a hazy rain come late.</br>
			The two guard dogs surprised</br>
			Whimper and howl in protest for they prefer to be</br>
			Unwashed and unkempt.</br>
			I left my letter and let them in</br>
			And after we dried off (forfeiting an hour),</br>
			The dogs struggled to forget the day and I tired to remember</br>
			All that has happened since last I wrote.</p>

			<p>The man with the voiceless yell &mdash; whoever he was,</br>
			And whatever happened to him, he will certainly never read this. He was</br>
			In nothing but an outfit of ragged trousers.</br>
			A clan of about a half-dozen men drew his body across the road.</br>
			His feet were two-cumbered paint stokes.</br>
			There isn’t much street light after dark. He was there for his
			snapshot,</br>
			Framed in the headlight beams of our passing vehicle. And then he was</br>
			Gone.</p>

			<p>Policenmen farm their beats. </br>
			Uniformed jackals with their bayonets at the fore. They </br>
			are wild</br>
			And let none pass</br>
			Without the exchange of dirty bills.</br>
			Pale tongues salivate, flailing, and crass.</br>
			Scavengers at night, officers by day patrolling the shantytowns</br>
			Hunched in silhouettes to the darkness.</p>

			<p>The cunning bandit who presides over the country leaves no hen untouched.</br>
			"Hail, hail the chief!"</br>
			The masses cluck in spasms, feathers lifted towards bouts of listless clouds as if to fly</br>
			Only it is high noon and the day’s heat beats them backwards
			In the street,</br>
			A large black cock plays</br>
			A vicious game of cat and mouse with a crippled frog.  His feet
			Laced together. His eyes</br>
			Burnt shut.</p>

			<p>The air is nostalgic somewhere,</br>
			Maybe where you are.</br>
			At a newspaper stand, a man hurries to make his daily exchange.</br>
			"Newspaper please" as he squints to make out the words, "Save Africa."</br>
			The man behind the booth collects his reward, "Savings it is?"</br>
			"Maybe I’ll retire there. Recolonize a bit of the darkness for myself."</br>

			<p>A ban of private militias passed by the other day</br>
			Leaving behind a littered trail of grenade shells and of cartridge cases to be collected</br>
			Windows shattered, carnage strewn – everywhere</br>
			They lay silently wrapped in each other’s arms, a hand</br>
			Strokes a face half-hidden in the red dirt – a contorted version of the truth</br>
			Am I to be harvester of limbs?</br>
			I will not sow – a foot here, a head there – for I do not wish to reap</br>
			Instead I walk until I’m tired, close my eyes, and try to weep</br>
			The bodies whisper, "It is time to sleep."</br>
			In the city, an elevator attendant in one run-down government ministry</br>
			Wants a bribe to take me down from the 7th floor to the</br>
			6th</p>

			<p>At the local zoo, there is a baffled bear with a sore-covered muzzle. </br>
			He licks his wounds, ashamed, between short, pockmarked breaths</br>
			His heart hammering,</br>
			He beats upon his own breast. A boy pounds the ground. His bare feet are silent, skipping in and out. In and out.</br>
			He will walk many miles to the Jehovah Jireh Hospital,</br>
			To sleep among the bones of his brothers and sisters.</br>
			Each night, his dreams are the same:</br>
			From the Jungle, the Lord’s Rebel Army draw closer to his village, Demon spawned, they emerge to –</br>
			A shadow appears for a moment. An AK&#8211;47 strapped to his person.</br>
			He has not come to quicken the dry bones of the valley, he is no Elijah.</br>
			"Fear not." His name is Gabriel.</p>

			<p>The milk&ndash;less mother peers into the distance,</br>
			She sings a chorus "You will be tall and strong / Rings of gold around your neck / leader of men."</br>
			A mirage appears &mdash;</br>
			A scrofulous eagle perches herself in a dropping-spattered nest.</br>
			The mother holds her swollen infant closer to her breast</br>
			"… You will live to be old and grey / trace the wisdom in you hands / legacy of no end." When the day breaks, I will tell you the triumphs of</br>

			Those we know: The hoarse, red-eyed jungle combatant. The </br>
			The Refugee. The Beggar. The Slum Dweller.</br>
			And those you have never heard of &mdash; </br>
			The Nameless.</br>
			I will have stories yet to tell, but I am tired.</br>
			Tired of stories;</br>
			for it is time to live.</p>
