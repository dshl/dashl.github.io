                        </h2>

                        <article class="">
                            <h6>
                                <em>The edge of mobile is hardware and with it, an exciting new way of experiencing the world.</em>
                            </h6>

                           	<p>There are three aphorisms in venture capital.
							<ol>
								<li>Software is eating the world.</li>
								<li>&quot;Atoms&quot; will outpace &quot;Bits.&quot;</li>
								<li>Hardware is the &quot;double black diamond.&quot; </li>
							</ol>

							<p>Popularized by Marc Andreessen, the first aphorism captures the phenomenon that traditional markets (from health to commerce to national defense) are increasingly disrupted by software and delivered as online services.</p>

							<p>The second aphorism is a reference to Peter Thiel&apos;s investment shift from consumer internet and media (Facebook; Stripe) to human systems and health (AltSchool; Collective Health). The claim is that true innovation is transformative, not iterative. <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kGND-uZolY%23t=7m30s'>&quot;The next Mark Zuckerberg won&apos;t build a social network, the next Bill Gates won&apos;t build an operating system,&quot; Thiel says. &quot;If you&apos;re copying these people you&apos;re not really learning from them.&quot;</a> The claim does not negate the notion that software is eating the world, but it does qualify its future potential. <strong>Moments in the history of business rarely repeat, but often build on each other, so those who want to catch the next big thing, must be contrarian in their foresight and diligent in their investments. </strong></p>

							<p>The last aphorism is a metaphor from <a href='http://trueventures.com/the-hardware-revolution-is-upon-us-and-why-it-matters/'>a 2013 post by True Ventures&apos; Jon Callaghan</a>. The premise is simple. <strong>Hardware is hard to build, to iterate upon, and to justify investment in.</strong> Hardware startups require extensive capital, production estimates are often delayed, supply chain management is tough, and balancing the consumer expectations of &quot;friendly&quot; yet &quot;robust&quot; is near impossible. <strong>So entrepreneurs have chosen to innovate on software and strategy.</strong> </p>

							<p>These aphorisms are respectively compelling, but taken together, it leads to an insight (2∴). </p>

							<ol>
								<li>Our world is becoming more connected through software.
									<p><em> ∴ All systems, including biological ones, will increasingly become systems on a chip (SoC). </em></p></li>

									</br>

								<li>SoCs require physical components because we (still) spend most of our life interacting with the real world.

									<p><em> ∴ The &quot;atom&quot; bet with the greatest market potential is hardware. </em></p></li>
							</ol>

							<p>In other words, we are in a moment in history where the reality of Moore&apos;s Law and a growing horizontal market makes hardware the category to watch. <strong>If technological innovation continues to bend exponentially, in which breakthroughs create a compounding swell of new opportunities, we are soon due for another wave.</strong> The edge of mobile is hardware and with it, an exciting new way of experiencing the world. The amplitude of this oncoming wave is reaching a critical level: the ease of rapid prototype modeling and component production, standardization of permissible data access, decreased market risk tolerance for beta products, feasibility of small-batch, contract manufacturing, etc. </p>

							<p><strong>In this tidal change, hardware is Moby Dick.</strong></p>

							<p>It may be tempting to say that hardware is the <em>next</em> Moby Dick, but that would be a mistake. Hardware in the past decade has had the largest startup acquisitions or market capitalizations compared to any other product category. Examples are not hard to find: Beats Electronics was acquired for $3B by Apple, the largest hardware manufacturer in the world with a market cap of $634.5B; Nest Labs was acquired for $3.2B by Google, which has a R&amp;D &quot;moonshots&quot; laboratory shipping hardware products like Google Glass, Project Loon, and self-driving cars; Nokia was acquired for $7.2B by Microsoft; Oculus VR was acquired for $2B by Facebook.</p>

								<p>This story gets lost because success in hardware has traditionally been elusive and almost everyday another consumer software company makes a splash with an outsized valuation. For example, WhatsApp, which was acquired for $19B by Facebook after its IPO in 2012 (though from Facebook&apos;s perspective, this was a do-or-die valuation). Below is an interactive map from <em>Simply Business</em> that illustrates the dominance of hardware over other sectors by comparing the acquisition strategies of Apple, Amazon, Google, Yahoo, and Facebook over the last 15 years.</p>

							<p>Hardware is a broad term so let&apos;s define the category. <strong>At a basic level, hardware is &quot;a durable tool&quot; which includes everything from rocks to military tanks. I prefer defining hardware as &quot;connected machinery.&quot;</strong> Therefore robotics, wearables, and IOT companies are included, while digital commerce companies innovating on distribution are not. Airware makes the cut. Warby Parker is left not. Both companies are innovative, but the latter innovates on strategy while the former innovates on product. </p>

							<p>Many dismissed the iPhone as a &quot;toy&quot; on its launch in 2007. Now Steve Jobs&apos; secret is  ubiquitous - the iPhone is a supercomputer (hardware) connected to a platform (the App Store) which redefines how we access and experience content. The fact that hardware could even mimic the simplicity and elegance of a toy should have been revealing. I still own an iphone4 because I believe it is the unadulterated expression of hardware ingenuity. </p>

							<p><strong>The future of connected machinery will be an incredible shift in computing. </strong></p>

							<p>Some of the best thinking on hardware comes from Estimote founder, Steve Cheney. Estimote is a company that creates contextually powered mobile experiences through small, wireless sensors called &quot;beacons&quot; and &quot;stickers&quot;. In a blog post titled, &quot;<a href='http://stevecheney.com/first-brain-computing-and-the-mouse-cursor-for-the-physical-world/'>First Brain Computing and the Mouse Cursor for the Physical World</a>&quot;, Cheney writes a bulleted list of considerations (choice selections below): </p>

							<ol>
								<li>One of the interesting but less sexy layers to making smart devices more contextually aware is the &apos;physical layer&apos;. The physical layer is the base layer of the networking stack, responsible for sending bytes of data through the air. </li>
								<li>[W]e need a &apos;new&apos; physical layer - stuff like sensors in the Apple M8 chip which record analog data about the ambient environment and beacons which know you&apos;re present. </li>
								<li>This new physical layer that is developing is actually a fused approach: very sophisticated sensors on the device, historical records from the cloud, predictive data science, and smart connected devices transmitting wireless signals. It&apos;s crazy cool futuristic stuff. We are basically building computers with brains that will live all around us. </li>
								<li>Today, you are the mouse cursor, and the physical world is the new canvas. </li>
							</ol>

							<p>An in-depth discussion of the points above can be found in <a href='https://soundcloud.com/a16z/location-context'>&quot;Location, Location, Location - and Mobile&quot;, a podcast featuring Cheney and Benedict Evans of A16Z.</a> <strong>Conditioned to spot breakaway consumer software apps, the idea of a &quot;new physical layer&quot; requires us to think deeply about what a successful hardware company will look like.</strong> We want to recognize Moby Dick when we see it, and more importantly, avoid schools of distraction - companies sticking a chip into an analog artifact and calling it &quot;smart&quot; hardware. The most baffling example of this market trend are wifi-based pet feeders, like <a href='http://catfi.com/'>Catfi (formerly Bistro)</a>, which raised $240K on Indiegogo and received pandering reviews from various news outlets. Wired magazine&apos;s headline read like a Buzzfeed top-10 list: &quot;<a href='http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-07/16/cat-facial-recognition-feeder'>Feline facial recognition feeder paves way for quantified cats.</a>&quot; This sort of thing reminds me of the Pets.com craze in the 90s. I didn&apos;t live this history, but at least I&apos;ve read about it - and more importantly, learned from it. </p>

							<p>Skilled fishermen cast their nets before dawn when the water is still calm. They say that as moonlight shines upon the sea, the scales of small and mid-sized fish shine like refracted stars. So by looking for these &quot;stars,&quot; fishermen are able to predict the swim patterns of a larger catch. <strong>The waters are relatively calm in hardware, and already there are rising stars (Nest, Estimote, and Tesla) that should be watched closely. Each of these companies have similar qualities: user-centric technology, a systematic approach to product development, and a vertically-integrated platform for the long tail of third-party partners. </strong></p>

							<p>Let&apos;s take each quality in turn. </p>

							<p>User-technology now seems self-explanatory, but only because Apple set a new standard for hardware design - the art of encasing an operating system inside a &quot;toy&quot;. Until then, we believed that the tools of the future would be complex, and therefore assumed that these tools would also be complicated, requiring specialized minds working in cohort (think Star Trek; Minority Report). Fortunately, the tools of the future will follow the paradigm of &quot;complex simplicity&quot; (think Her). <strong>Since hardware companies increasingly build for the average consumer, their products tend to encase powerful software into components that seamlessly interact with the physical world around us.</strong> Imagine a world where devices monitor and sense our environments, collect data and provide context-aware feedback, add another level of sense perception which allows for &quot;cognitive offloading&quot;, fosters play, and reawakens wonder. </p>

							<p><strong>The focus on user-centricity is a design decision that informs business strategy.</strong> Loved products lead to brand loyalty, and brand loyalty translates into higher customer lifetime value, either through the purchase of additional SKUs that play well with the current product offerings (systematic product development) or recurring revenue generated from third-party partners (via a vertically-integrated platform). </p>

							<p>Systematic product development leverages customer trust to provide increased services: &quot;the more you use our toy(s), the better your life (and our system) becomes&quot;, while a vertically integrated platform contracts competitors into partners: &quot;we will share our toy(s), but determine how you use it.&quot; Both revenue streams guard against the market trend of hardware commoditization and lower margins over time. More importantly, as each new customer and application adds value to the ecosystem, this design-first, business strategy exhibits network effects; and, in a world where everything is connected, it will be the likes of which we have never seen before. </p>

							<p>As Herman Melville says, &quot;It is not down on any map; true places never are.&quot; </p>
