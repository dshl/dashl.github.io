                            <p>
                                I woke up punctually at 5:30am. Sliding out from under my cocoon of sheets, I began my morning routine and dressed myself in a
                                tie, collared shirt, and slacks. Accompanied by the house cat, Mr. Whiskers, I would then walk to the refrigerator, ransack
                                last night's leftovers into my backpack, and trek down the stairs into the garage. The stairs creaked. So, I always had to walk
                                slowly, careful not to apply my body weight too heavily on any step. In the garage, I would select one of the many quality
                                bicycles stored there and ride down sloping hills towards work.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I lived in a home&ndash;stay blocks away from the Haight&ndash;Ashbury district of San Francisco. People say "home is where the
                                heart is" and Ms. Otero, single mother of three, was the heart of this home &mdash; a heart that enveloped the entire
                                community. Almost every evening, neighborhood friends would gather in her kitchen to cook, and with a fine bottle of wine we
                                would stay up into the night, laughing and playing games.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <b>I woke up before sunrise today, like everyday, to bike into the San Francisco Day School garage around 6:20am</b>, ride the
                                elevator to the main floor, and greet Ray, the security guard. I loved coming in this early in the morning: the hallways were
                                empty, the copy machine was all mine, and I could revel in the peace and quiet of my own thoughts.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I would walk into my classroom to prepare the white&ndash;board. On the far right hand side, I would update a
                                cross&ndash;section of the board, divided it into four sections: date, objective, schedule, and homework. After filling in
                                these sections, I would sometimes walk around the classroom with pencil in one hand, my lesson plan on a clipboard in another.
                                I cherished this rehearsal for these empty seats would soon be filled with children and their impressionable minds.

                                By 7:30am, I was in the faculty lounge for a formal check&ndash;in with the other teachers, and by 8am, the day officially
                                began with what we called, "Morning Greeting." <b>As the students arrived at school, we would greet them with a themed dance
                                party.</b>

                                Collaborative: San Francisco &mdash; a place where everyone believes in the magic of learning, and its power to change lives.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Consider these facts: <sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">[1]</a></sup>
                            </p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>In 2009, only 14% of African-American and 17% of Latino eighth graders achieved proficiency in reading and math, compared
                                to 41% and 45% of their White and Asian classmates.
                                </li>

                                <li>Only 60% of America's low&ndash;income youth can expect to graduate from high school; 1/3 can expect to enroll in college;
                                and merely 1/7 will earn a bachelor's degree.
                                </li>

                                <li>Low&ndash;income youth are 5 times less likely to earn a bachelor's degree by age 24 than a child from a
                                high&ndash;resourced family. <sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">[2]</a></sup>
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>
                                The stakes are high. A recent McKinsey &amp; Co report argues that <a href="bit.ly/1PC2Qrl">"the quality of an educational
                                system cannot exceed the quality of its teachers."</a> In fact, the quality of a teacher is the single most important variable
                                in the classroom. Even so, the challenge of education transcends the classroom. According to University of Washington economist
                                Dan Goldhaber, about 60% of achievement is explained by non&ndash;school factors.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The situation seems dire, but education reform has seen a resurgence. New thought&ndash;leaders are inspiring a national
                                conversation. Follow the work of Geoffrey Canada of the holistic charter school network, <a href="hcz.org">Harlem Children's
                                Zone</a>, Michelle Rhee of the political advocacy group, <a href=
                                "https://www.studentsfirst.org">StudentsFirst</a>, Sal Khan of <a href="khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a>, Dave Levin and
                                Michael Feinberg of <a href="www.kipp.org">KIPP public charter schools</a>, among others, and you quickly realize that the
                                common thread among these innovators is a no&ndash;excuse policy about the potential inherent in every child.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Throughout my summer at Breakthrough, I taught in a room which was as both a guidance counselor's office and an 8th grade
                                Honor's English classroom during the calendar school year. It was a small, intimate space that barely fit nine desks let alone
                                accommodate nine students, and teacher twice a day for 45 minutes. <b>I was a 5th grade writing teacher. My summer objective
                                was to teach 18 students how to write a personal narrative. I also set out to capture their hearts and arrest their minds with
                                the magic of learning.</b>
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The students called me "Mr. Dash" and on my door hung a picture of the character 'Dash' from the <em>Incredibles</em>. Next to
                                the whiteboard, I had a newspaper clipping which read in bold, black letters, "TOTURE IS OVER." Each day as the students
                                prepared to leave my class, I would point to the poster and say, "Torture is over," and they would respond, "No, Mr. Dash,
                                torture has just begun!" It was our inside&ndash;joke. Within the first week, I collected 6 assignments without names that
                                promptly found their way into recycling. Those 6 students missed recess to redo the <em>missing</em> assignment. I soon found
                                myself in a trio student's called the "strict teachers" of Breakthrough (and I wore the title as a badge of honor). My students
                                knew that I had their best interest at heart and expected no less than their absolute best. I knew that the world would expect
                                much more from them with much less care and support.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I learned a lot from my students. One student in particular was Kayla. <sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel=
                                "footnote">[3]</a></sup> Like many her age, Kayla was a curious extrovert who struggled with a mild case of ADHD. Most days,
                                Kayla would ask so many questions in class that it became a hindrance to my instruction and a discouragement to her when she
                                was ignored. <b>Due to the limited time I had with my students, not all questions could be asked, or answered without wasting
                                valuable time so I decided to implement a teaching tool called "Parking Lots."</b> I placed a sticky note on the upper right
                                hand corner of each class desk. Students could now jot down the questions unaddressed in class. Throughout the class period, I
                                would collect these notes and stick them on the whiteboard where parking lot lanes were drawn for these "sticky questions."
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Most students had a hard time understanding my intention with these sticky notes, but that was ok. <b>The notes became another
                                line of communication between my students and me. While some students used the notes to tell me about personal concerns or even
                                make connections to other material, Kayla learned to focus her questions.</b> At the end of class, along with her classwork,
                                she would hand&ndash;in her sticky note and I would clear up misunderstandings over lunch. If she didn't have a question, Kayla
                                would turn in sticky note with a smiley face. The summer transformation was magical. <b>Kayla could barely sit through a 45
                                minute class let alone articulate her thoughts but by summer's end, she among others were writing masterpieces.</b>
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I loved what I was doing. I worked on average seventy hours a week, slept late, rose early, and bent over backwards to teach
                                (and re&ndash;teach) my lessons. <b>Life had purpose and it was found in these children who taught me to not only believe in
                                magic, but to live under its power every day.</b>
