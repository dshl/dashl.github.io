		<article class="">
					<h6><em>The Christian hipster is a person who is not so much inauthentic but striving too hard for authenticity</em></br></h6>

			<p>"What is bothering me is the question what Christianity really is, or indeed who Christ really is, for us today." So wrote the pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer from his Berlin prison cell in April 1944, one year before he was hanged by the SS for complicity in various plots against Hitler's life. Bonhoeffer's words were not addressed to the <em>good man</em> he called Savior, but to the church which called itself Christian. It is a question that still bothers today.</p>

			<p><b>In a small church nestled away from the lure of the world, a little child worries his parents with nagging questions: "What is Christianity?" "Who is Christ?" The incessant child has yet to learn the art of daydreaming during sermons after leaving his doubts at the door. In a few years, the child will grow up and leave the church, never to return.</b></p>

			<p>Despite packed megachurches, political clout, and increasing visibility on the national stage, Christian evangelical leaders are warning one another that their children – now or soon-to-be teenagers – are abandoning the faith in droves. Some suggest that the 'Christian-teen-dropout-epidemic' is a symptom of 'post-Christian America,' which sounds like a cool, somewhat edgy way of saying nothing at all. After the shock wears off we can all just take a step back and analyze the situation like a Brechtian drama. True: according to The Barna Group (an evangelical Christian polling firm) <a href="bit.ly/1PPzZur">nearly three out of every five young Christians (59%) disconnect either permanently or for an extended period of time from church.</a> And yes, <b>we live in an age that trivializes religion and normalizes secularism. But most youth are not abandoning their faith, just abandoning the church.</b></p>

			<p><b>Cue a new subculture of young evangelicals – <em>Christian Hipsters</em> – who seek aesthetic sensibility and intellectual rigor.</b> Not that Christianity is void of aesthetes (Fyodor Dostoevsky, G.K. Chesterton, Paul Tillich) or intellectuals (Dietrich Bonheoffer, C.S. Lewis, Francis Schaeffer). It's just that this new generation of believers seek a more worldly faith, one that doesn't reject outright the culture, ideas, and art of the secular world. They look up to young Christian authors and pastors like Rob Bell and Donald Miller, adore indie-folk musicians like Sufjan Stevens, and have a nostalgic curiosity for ancient church liturgies and prayers. They have begun to dress and act like secular hipsters: drinking beer, getting tattoos, riding fixed-gear bikes, and eating raw and organic foods. They take interest in a broader range of issues (the environment, HIV/AIDS, globalization) than their parents' generation, and don't feel pigeonholed to the Republican Party, or conservatism for that matter.</p>

			<p><b>FOUR SHADES OF COOL</b></p>

			<p>Trading in the 'cross' for 'cool,' doctrine for spiritual improvisation, this is not just youthful exuberance, but carefree hedonism. It's like watching a jazz composition unfold, undaunted by the occasional, accidental grace notes along the way. <b>Brett McCrakken's new book <a href="amzn.to/1PPA8xS"><em>Hipster Christianity: When Church and Cool Collide</em></a> chronicles four well-worn categories: the Artistic Searcher, the Frugal Collegian, the Bookish Intellectual, and the Monied Yuppie.</b></p>

			<p>I took the quiz on McCrakken's website, scored a 54/120, and discovered that this meant that I am "Bookish Intellectual." What does this mean? The details are below but in brief, <em>I prioritize the life of the mind</em>; <em>I am conversant in all manner of mid-century Christian existentialism</em> (not really, I'm more of aware of the atheistic brand: Nietzsche, Sartre, Derrida); <em>I am a frequent user of such words as "Other," "problematize," "ecclesiology," and "historicity"</em> (guilty, but I'm working on this habit); and, <em>I am impressively well-read</em> (more like impressively well aware of all the right books). I know the value of being self-aware but I'm starting to sound like the kid who sits all alone in the cafeteria reading because he knows too much about things nobody cares about. And to top it off, says it in a way no one can understand. But alas, 'tis true.</p>

			<p>So out of the four types of Hipster I could be, it seems fitting that I'm the least 'hip' of them of all. I'm not sure how to react to the results. I fluctuate between fearing that I will be unable to revel in the irony of making something 'nerdy', someday cool; or, maybe, this is all for the better – an inadvertent validation of just how cool I am. The whole point of hipsterdom is to be opaquely understood by an ever selective group of people, right? So, that's it. I'm so hipster, even hipsters can't understand me. Take that for non-conformity.</p>

			<p><b>Hipster Christianity may not be the best term to describe this emergent subculture of young Protestants.</b> The term is too amorphous and appears to only repackage the prosaic reality of just how far we've come since <em>Mere Christianity</em>. But as shifty as the term may be, 'hipster' may be the exact adjective to describe a generation of Christians that don't want to be branded anyway. Besides, try saying it aloud – slowly: "Christian Hipster." The phrase has a literary seductiveness that is aesthetically pleasing, wouldn't you say?</p></br>

					<p><b>MY CHRISTIAN HIPSTER QUOTIENT</b></p>
					<p><b>54 / 120</b></p>
					<hr>
					<p>Low CHQ. You probably belong to the purpose-driven, seeker-sensitive, Hawaiian shirt-wearing Christian establishment, even though you are open to some of the "rethinking Christianity" stuff. You seem to like edginess in some measure but become uneasy when your idea of Christian orthodoxy is challenged by some renegade young visionary who claims the virgin birth isn't necessary<p>

			<p><b>HIPPIES, HIPSTERS, AND HYSTERIA</b></p>

			<p>Christian Hipsters grew up on Contemporary Christian music, Focus on the Family's Adventures in Odyssey, flannel graphs, vacation Bible school, and hysteria about the end times. Though, somewhere between Sunday School and young adulthood, they stumbled across Acts, the biblical book of history which records how early believers sold their possessions, took interest in the poor, and gave their lives to each other with reckless abandon long before it was taken away from them by the hands of their enemies. <b>Christianity was a faith of action – not presentation or performance – simple in its message, authentic in its ways.</b></p>

			<p>Faith within four walls now seemed constricting. Schlocky kitsch. Instead of a Christianity that is alive and transformative, the budding Christian hipster saw that church had become a parade of mumbling "amens," fuddy-duddy legalism, apathy about the arts, and a pitiful lack of concern for social justice.</p>

			<p>In classical hipster fashion, young evangelicals have begun to question the corporate mentality of the purpose-driven church, longing for a back-to-basics faith that is more about serving the poor than serving Starbucks in the church vestibule. As the Christian hipster grows into his own, the primary focus is on looking for this <em>good man</em> named Jesus. Not the Je$us of ostentatious mega churches, the Jesus of Western exceptionalism, the Jesus who salutes the Stars and Stripes, worries over whether the Ten Commandments are in courtrooms, and supports preachers who get too involved in conservative politics. But the Jesus who preached a message of unbridled freedom found alone in Him. The one who gave his life so others may live eternally (John 3:16), abundantly (John 10:10), and joyfully (Rom 5:11).</p>

			<p><b>Sounds like a spiritual revival. And it is. Only most people don't know it yet. Even Christian hipsters seem unaware that they are another installment in the protracted narrative of the Protestant Reformation.</b> Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield led the First Great Awakening in the 1740s and there have been others since: the frontier camp meetings at the beginning of the 19th century, the Great Revivals of the 1850s, the Jesus People of the 1960s.</p>

			<p>Ah, the 60's. The decade when post-war children were transformed from younger versions of their parents – church on Sundays, crew cuts, knee-length skirts – into counterculture revolutionaries who 'dropped in' and 'drugged out'. Yet by the end of the decade, many a hippy would embrace Christ as the most persistent symbol of purity, selfishness, and brotherly love. <b>Jesus was, after all, a radical nonconformist, a free spirit practitioner of medicine and winemaking, and the presumed leader of an underground liberation movement who associated himself with criminals, subversives, and street people.</b> It may be sacrilegious to call the "Son of God" a hippie or a hipster (the later more so), but he was a Bohemian of sorts. And at most, the living God who is both Savior and Judge, the ruler of all destinies.</p>

			<p>The Jesus People, also known as Street Christians or Jesus Freaks, came as quickly as they went, losing steam when blending counterculture and conservative religion became mainstream. By the 1980s, most of the prodigal sons and daughters traded in their flower skirts and unshaved beards for argyle sweaters and some penny loafers. But not all was lost.</p>

			<p><b>A NEW MAINSTREAM</b></p>

			<p>Remnants of the hippie Christian movement have remained. In many ways it's been transplanted into the modern Christian Hipster movement: the childlike awe of nature, a renewed concern for justice, an appreciation for the simple pleasures of life: riding bikes along rivers, enjoying company around a well-lit fire, finding leisure in the creative, the well-crafted, and the beauty within all forms of music, books, and film.</p>

			<p><b>Mainstream evangelicalism is still alive, but regenerated in a radical new form for a growing number of young Americans.</b> The biblical angels oft found themselves comforting, "Be not afraid." These words are true even today. Understandably Christian hipsters have awhile before they can be viewed as anything more than the rebellion of reprobate youth. McCrakken put it best when he said: "The challenge for hipster Christians is to figure out what it means, in their cultural context, to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness (Eph. 4:24). We are new creations [not a dressed-up rehashing of our old selves] … the old has passed away" (2 Cor. 5:17).</p>

			<p>Yet why would Christian hipsters practice their faith in the way they do if it didn't feel sincere to them? From the outside, looking in, one realizes quickly that love is at the center of this movement – inherent and honest – deeper than the whims and fading sentiments of young adulthood. <b>The love is grounded in the 'leap of faith' that is Jesus Christ, which has produced a genuine sense of joy long forsaken by traditional Christianity.</b> The old guard should take some notes from these young children. Maybe – just maybe – the Christian hipster is a person who is not so much inauthentic as he is striving for authenticity.</p>
